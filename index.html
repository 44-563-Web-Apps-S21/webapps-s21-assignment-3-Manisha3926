            <hr><h5>C++</h5>
            <blockquote>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.The C++ language has two main components: a direct mapping of hardware features provided primarily by the C subset, and zero-overhead abstractions based on those mappings. Stroustrup describes C++ as "a light-weight abstraction programming language for building and using efficient and elegant abstractions and "offering both hardware access and abstraction is the basis of C++. Doing it efficiently is what distinguishes it from other languages</blockquote>
